The objectives are:\n\n1. Work closely with TE/GE employees and the Product Owner to perform regular user research to develop and prioritize a full gamut of user stories and requirements.\n2. Work with the IRS IT Department to understand the project technical \"guardrails\" (e.g., available software, security requirements, current infrastructure).\n3. Develop multiple implementation options that consider user needs and address them within existing IRS technical guardrails.\n4. Ensure the solution is fully automated (i.e., solution intakes content to be redacted from internal databases/software and sends redacted content to tools/software/website to be shared publicly).\n5. Implement solutions as approved by both the Product Owner and IRS IT.\n6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) shall be fully operational by December 2024 with continuous improvements being made through the Agile Sprint process for the remainder of the base year.\n7. Establish and document a change management system to maintain changes and provide continuous improvements to the product workflow.\n\nThe RFQ is seeking innovative solutions that can improve the current data redaction process, which involves removing or redacting private and sensitive information from tax exempt applications, determination letters, and 990 series returns. The goal is to minimize or eliminate the risk of improper disclosure, reduce processing times, reduce costs, and reduce required human inputs into the redaction process.",

The solution must meet specific requirements, including image quality, lighting, and bandwidth considerations.\n\n**Section 3: Operational Questions**\nThe RFI asks vendors to provide information on how their solution would enable CBP to implement the strategic vision for "on the move" entry and streamline the traveler experience. Vendors are also asked to describe how they would provide visual notification of biometric match or no-match results to CBP officers.\n\n**Section 4: Technical Questions**\nThe RFI asks vendors to provide technical information about their solution, including image capture device specifications, remote adjustment capabilities, and back-end technology architecture.\n\n**Section 5: Environmental & Human Factor Questions**\nVendors are asked to describe how their solution would handle varying environmental conditions, such as lighting and weather, and how it would filter out non-human images (e.g., clothing).\n\n**Section 6: Cost and Delivery Questions**\nThe RFI asks vendors to provide information on the cost and delivery timeline for their solution, including any additional software or services required.\n\n**Section 7: Prior Performance Questions**\nVendors are asked about their previous experience with similar solutions, including average volume handled, technical readiness level, and performance results.\n\n**Section 8: Follow Up Questions and No-Cost Vendor Demonstration**\nThe RFI invites vendors to submit a video demonstration of their technology at no cost to CBP. Vendors are also asked if they would be interested in receiving follow-up questions from the government.\n\n**Section 9: Submission Instructions**\nThe RFI provides instructions for submitting responses, including email subject line and attachment requirements.\n\n**Section 10: Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement**\nThe government will not publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this effort. Vendors are asked to identify any information as "Proprietary or Confidential" to the fullest extent possible.\n\nPlease note that these sections are based on my understanding of the provided text, and I may have missed some details or grouped certain questions together.

Work with the IRS IT Department to understand the project technical "guardrails" (e.g., available software, security requirements, current infrastructure).\n3. Develop multiple implementation options that consider user needs and address them within existing IRS technical guardrails.\n4. Ensure solution is fully automated (i.e., solution intakes content to be redacted from internal databases/software and sends redacted content to tools/software/website to be shared publicly).\n5. Implement solutions as approved by both the Product Owner and IRS IT.\n6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) shall be fully operational by December 2024 with continuous improvements being made through the Agile Sprint process for the remainder of the base year.\n7.

The RFI aims to identify potential solutions that can meet CBP's requirements for biometric facial comparison technology, particularly in the context of on-the-move capture.\n\n**Contract Overview**\n\n* Contract Title: On The Move Biometric Facial Comparison Technology\n* Issuing Agency: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n* Purpose: To gather information from vendors regarding potential solutions for biometric facial comparison technology\n\n**Description**\n\nThe RFI seeks to identify vendors who can provide biometric facial comparison technology that can be used in on-the-move capture scenarios, such as at airports or border crossings. The technology should be able to accurately compare and match images of individuals in real-time.\n\n**Background**\n\nCBP is seeking to upgrade its existing biometric facial comparison technology to improve the efficiency and accuracy of traveler identification and verification processes.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe objectives of this RFI are:\n\n1. To gather information from vendors regarding potential solutions for on-the-move biometric facial comparison technology.\n2. To identify vendors who can provide accurate and efficient image capture and comparison capabilities.\n3. To determine the feasibility of integrating the selected vendor's solution with existing CBP systems.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe scope of this RFI includes:\n\n1. Technical requirements: The RFI outlines specific technical requirements for the biometric facial comparison technology, including accuracy rates, processing times, and compatibility with existing systems.\n2. Environmental and human factor considerations: The RFI also considers environmental and human factors that may impact the performance of the technology, such as lighting conditions, image quality, and potential biases in the algorithm.\n3. Cost and delivery: The RFI asks vendors to provide information on costs associated with implementing their solution, including any additional software or services required.\n\n**Submission Instructions**\n\nVendors are required to submit responses electronically by September 2, 2024, using a specific email subject line. Responses should be provided in a Microsoft Word document attachment and include all requested documentation.\n\n**Confidentiality**\n\nThe Government will not publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this effort. Any information submitted by interested parties may be shared with support contractors hired to assist the Government.\n\n**Prior Performance Questions**\n\nVendors are asked to provide information on their prior performance, including any previous connections to TVS in a field environment.\n\n**Follow-Up Questions and No-Cost Vendor Demonstration**\n\nThe RFI allows vendors to submit follow-up questions and a no-cost vendor demonstration of their technology.", 'Source': 'RFI_On_the_Move_Capture.pdf'}
